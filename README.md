This a side project and also a _sidebar_ project.
More like paying a hommage to the original project.
I´d like to fill the _waiting time_ by shuffling around code within the excalibrain to see what happens. 
Mainly, perhaps try to squeeze the tree view into a side bar and in that regard "clean up" the display for this particular use scenario.
With my meager coding knowledge I should be able to do that, without disrupting the functionality.

As [@zsviczian](https://twitter.com/zsviczian) said in this [twitter/x post](https://x.com/zsviczian/status/1834485660566052940?s=20) in september 2024, ExcaliBrain might be regarded as a "stop-gap solution", by that i suppose he means that the use of [obsidian dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [obsidian excalidraw](https://excalidraw-obsidian.online/Welcome) within obsidian itself shouldn't be regarded as the final solution. 

Currently the project is tended in _maintenance mode_.

But what a beauty excalibrain is. And even then, as Zsolt points out in his tweet, "it does not even come close to the beauty and elegance of [TheBrain's graph](https://www.thebrain.com)" where the idea of the visual node display seems to have originated. 

_**IF**_ i were to stumble upon gold (.. more like finding a new planet in our solar system), I would of course submit my findings to The Owner.

Then multiple mentions of [excalibrain](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain) in his [Sketch your mind](https://www.amazon.com/Sketch-Your-Mind-Nurture-Creative-ebook) book.

This is a thread that sheds some light on priority:

several parallel developers. Perhaps look at this?

What is 'React' (built _natively_) ?

# Prerequisites as of 2025
ExcaliBrain is built on top of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin). You must have both these plugins installed and enabled for ExcaliBrain to work.
